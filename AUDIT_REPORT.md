## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found & Fixes Needed

### Critical Issues
**None found** - No blocking issues for release

### Medium Priority Issues

1. **Transformers Version Compatibility**
   - **File:** `examples/basic_inference.py`
   - **Issue:** Uses deprecated `torch_dtype` parameter
   - **Status:** Already fixed in `examples/generate.py` (uses `dtype`)
   - **Action:** Update `basic_inference.py` to use `dtype` parameter
   - **Fix:**
   ```python
   # Line 80: Change from
   dtype=dtype,  # Changed from torch_dtype
   ```

2. **Transformers Package Version**
   - **Issue:** Latest transformers (4.57.0) has breaking changes
   - **Current Workaround:** Pinned to 4.44.2 in requirements
   - **Action:** Document this in README or setup guide
   - **Status:** Working as-is, but should be noted

### Low Priority Issues

1. **Network Topology Information Removed**
   - **Files:** `scripts/setup/*.sh`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
   - **Action Taken:** All setup scripts and deployment documentation containing network topology removed
   - **Status:** ‚úÖ Resolved - No sensitive network information in public repository

2. **PROJECT_PLAN.md and reorganize.sh**
   - **Issue:** These are historical documents from development
   - **Action:** Consider moving to `docs/archive/` or removing
   - **Status:** Non-blocking, cosmetic issue

3. **QUICKSTART.md vs README.md**
   - **Issue:** Some overlap between these files
   - **Action:** Consider consolidating or making QUICKSTART a simple reference to README
   - **Status:** Non-blocking

## üìä Testing Results

### Automated Tests
- **Status:** No test suite currently exists
- **Recommendation:** Add pytest tests in future version
- **Impact:** Non-blocking for MVP

### Manual Testing
- ‚úÖ Web UI loads correctly
- ‚úÖ API server starts without errors
- ‚úÖ Frontend builds successfully
- ‚úÖ Configuration file (config.yaml) properly formatted
- ‚úÖ Makefile commands work as expected
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Image generation not tested in this audit (requires GPU time)

### Browser Compatibility
- **Tested:** Chrome-based browsers (via UI inspection)
- **Expected:** Should work in all modern browsers (React 18 + ES6)
- **Recommendation:** Test in Firefox, Safari before announcing

---

## üîí Security Considerations

### For Public Release
1. ‚úÖ No sensitive information in repository
2. ‚úÖ No hardcoded secrets
3. ‚úÖ Proper .gitignore configuration
4. ‚úÖ Dependencies from trusted sources (PyPI, npm)
5. ‚úÖ MIT License allows commercial use

### For Users
1. **Local Use:** API has no authentication (by design for local use)
2. **Network Access:** Users should be aware SMB shares expose images on network
3. **Model Downloads:** ~5GB download on first run from Hugging Face Hub
4. **GPU Access:** Full system GPU access required (standard for ML apps)
