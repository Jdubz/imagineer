## üóëÔ∏è Scripts Removed (Use Makefile Instead)

| Old Script | New Command |
|-----------|-------------|
| `scripts/start_api.sh` | `make api` |
| `scripts/start_server.sh` | `make api` |
| `scripts/start_dev.sh` | `make dev` |
| `scripts/generate.sh` | `make generate PROMPT="..."` |
| `scripts/deploy/setup-cloudflare-tunnel.sh` | Use custom version |

**Why?** All functionality is available through well-documented Makefile targets. Run `make help` to see all commands.

---

## üîç Can't Find Something?

**Option 1: Use the Documentation Index**
```bash
# Open the comprehensive index
cat docs/INDEX.md
# Or view in browser/editor
```

**Option 2: Search by name**
```bash
# Find any documentation file
find docs -name "*KEYWORD*.md"

# Example: Find deployment docs
find docs -name "*DEPLOY*.md"
```

**Option 3: Search by content**
```bash
# Search all markdown files for a keyword
grep -r "keyword" docs/*.md
```

---

## üìö New Files Created

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/docs/INDEX.md` | Complete documentation catalog |
| `/REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md` | Detailed reorganization summary |
| `/docs/WHERE_DID_IT_GO.md` | This file! |
| `/scripts/reorganize-project.sh` | Reorganization automation script |

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Verification

Everything is working correctly if:

```bash
# Root only has essential files
ls *.md
# Shows: CLAUDE.md, README.md, REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md

# Docs are organized
ls docs/
# Shows: INDEX.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, API.md, deployment/, lora/, guides/

# Makefile commands work
make help
make api
make dev
```
