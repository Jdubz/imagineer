# CPU Diagnostic Report - 2025-10-16

## Problem Summary
System running extremely slowly due to only 1 out of 20 CPU cores being active.

## System Specifications
- **CPU**: Intel Core i9-10900X @ 3.70GHz
- **Total Cores**: 10 physical cores, 20 threads
- **RAM**: 64GB (52GB available)
- **Disk**: Plenty of space available

## Issue Discovered
- Only CPU 0 was online and active
- CPUs 1-19 were offline
- Load average was 2.88-3.99 on single core (severe overload)
- CPU usage was 78.6% user, 21.4% system, 0% idle

## Actions Taken
1. Identified that 19 out of 20 CPUs were offline
2. Ran command to enable all cores:
   ```bash
   for cpu in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu{1..19}/online; do
       echo 1 | sudo tee $cpu
   done
   ```
3. Verified sysfs files show "1" (online) for all CPUs 1-19
4. However, kernel is not actually using the CPUs yet

## Current State
- **sysfs status**: All CPUs show as "1" (online) in `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/online`
- **Actual status**: Kernel still only recognizes and uses CPU 0
- **Diagnosis**: Hotplug mechanism didn't fully restore the CPUs

## Solution Required
**REBOOT NEEDED** - The cores are marked online but kernel hasn't re-initialized them.

## Post-Reboot Verification Commands

Run these commands after reboot to verify all cores are working:

```bash
# Check number of online CPUs (should show 20)
nproc

# Check online CPU list (should show 0-19)
lscpu | grep "On-line"

# Check per-CPU activity (should show all 20 cores)
mpstat -P ALL 1 1

# Check load average (should be much lower)
uptime

# Verify core count in /proc
grep -c processor /proc/cpuinfo
```

## Expected Results After Reboot
- `nproc` should return: **20**
- `lscpu` should show: **On-line CPU(s) list: 0-19**
- `/proc/cpuinfo` should show: **20** processors
- Load average should be distributed across all cores
- System responsiveness should be dramatically improved

## Investigation Needed (Optional)
To find out why the cores were disabled in the first place:
```bash
sudo dmesg | grep -i "cpu.*offline\|cpu.*disabled" | tail -30
```

This might reveal:
- Thermal issues
- Hardware errors
- Manual intervention
- Power management settings

## Notes
- Memory and disk were healthy - not the cause of slowness
- Swap barely used (136KB out of 8GB)
- This issue was purely CPU-related
