# Imagineer - Consolidated Implementation Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-28
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for what's been implemented and what remains

---

## Executive Summary

The Imagineer project has made **substantial progress** on the core vision of a multi-user AI image generation and training platform. The majority of backend infrastructure and frontend UI components are in place. Outstanding work is primarily **bug fixes, integration gaps, and polish** rather than major new features.

### Overall Progress: ~85% Complete

- ‚úÖ **Phase 1 (Foundation & Security):** 95% complete
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2 (Album System):** 90% complete
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Phase 3 (AI Labeling):** 70% complete (backend done, frontend UI gaps)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Phase 4 (Web Scraping):** 80% complete (configuration issue)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Phase 5 (Training Pipeline):** 75% complete (state persistence issues)

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Security ‚úÖ (95% Complete)

### ‚úÖ Completed Items

1. **Google OAuth Authentication** (server/auth.py)
   - OAuth login/callback/logout endpoints working
   - Session management via Flask sessions
   - User roles stored in database (server/database.py)
   - Admin-only decorators (@require_admin)

2. **Database Layer** (server/database.py)
   - SQLAlchemy models: Image, Album, Label, AlbumImage, ScrapeJob, TrainingRun
   - SQLite database at instance/imagineer.db
   - Migration scripts (scripts/migrate_to_database.py, scripts/index_images.py)

3. **Security Measures**
   - CORS configured for production domains
   - Flask-Talisman security headers
   - Structured logging (server/logging_config.py)
   - Secret key runtime enforcement

4. **API Organization**
   - Route blueprints created: images.py, albums.py, scraping.py, training.py
   - Shared type definitions (shared/schema/, server/shared_types.py)
   - Contract tests for backend/frontend alignment

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Outstanding Issues

1. **Endpoint Duplication (HIGH PRIORITY)**
   - Both `server/api.py` and `server/routes/images.py` expose image/thumbnail logic
   - The blueprint version (routes/images.py) has the latest safety checks
   - **Action:** Consolidate to use blueprints exclusively, remove duplicates from api.py

2. **Migration History Tracking (MEDIUM)**
   - Migration scripts exist but no marker to confirm execution in each environment
   - **Action:** Add Alembic or simple migration flag/table

3. **Secret Management**
   - Environment variables properly enforced
   - ‚úÖ No hardcoded secrets remain
   - ‚úÖ FLASK_SECRET_KEY validation in production

---

## Phase 2: Album System & Image Management ‚úÖ (90% Complete)

### ‚úÖ Completed Items

1. **Album CRUD Operations**
   - Create/read/update/delete albums (server/routes/albums.py, server/api.py lines 1766-1975)
   - Add/remove images from albums
   - Album cover image selection
   - Training source flag for albums

2. **Image Management**
   - Image upload endpoint with admin auth (server/routes/images.py)
   - Public image listing with pagination
   - NSFW filtering (is_nsfw flag, is_public flag)
   - Thumbnail generation (300px WebP format)

3. **Frontend UI**
   - AlbumsTab.tsx (366 lines) - Album browser and manager
   - ImageGallery component
   - Thumbnail display and image modals

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Outstanding Issues

1. **Album Analytics Missing (LOW PRIORITY)**
   - Plan mentioned album analytics/search
   - Only basic pagination implemented
   - **Action:** Add if needed, but not critical for MVP

2. **Image Search (LOW PRIORITY)**
   - No keyword search on images/labels yet
   - **Action:** Future enhancement if user feedback demands it

---

## Phase 3: AI Labeling System ‚ö†Ô∏è (70% Complete)

### ‚úÖ Completed Items

1. **Claude CLI Docker Integration**
   - Docker image for Claude CLI (docker/claude-cli/Dockerfile)
   - Ephemeral container execution (server/services/labeling_cli.py)
   - Mount credentials securely
   - Automatic cleanup after labeling

2. **Backend Labeling Service**
   - Celery tasks: label_image_task, label_album_task (server/tasks/labeling.py)
   - API endpoints: /api/labeling/image/<id>, /api/labeling/album/<id>
   - Task status tracking: /api/labeling/tasks/<task_id>
   - NSFW classification and tag persistence

3. **Database Integration**
   - Label model with image_id foreign key
   - Label types: caption, tag, category
   - Source tracking: claude, manual, scraper

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Outstanding Issues

1. **Async Task Naming Mismatch (HIGH PRIORITY)**
   - API returns 202 + task_id for async labeling
   - Tests (tests/backend/test_phase3_labeling.py) assume synchronous execution
   - Celery routing expects `server.tasks.labeling.*` but tasks registered as `tasks.*`
   - **Action:** Align task names/routes, update tests to handle async flow

2. **Frontend Labeling UI Missing (HIGH PRIORITY)**
   - No LabelingPanel or batch labeling dialogs in React
   - No `/api/labeling` API calls in frontend code
   - Users cannot trigger labeling from UI
   - **Action:** Add labeling UI to AlbumsTab or create dedicated LabelingTab

3. **Label Analytics Missing (MEDIUM)**
   - No endpoints for label statistics, tag clouds, etc.
   - **Action:** Add if valuable for training workflows

4. **Manual Tag Editing (LOW)**
   - Plan mentioned manual tag UI
   - **Action:** Future enhancement

---

## Phase 4: Web Scraping Integration ‚ö†Ô∏è (80% Complete)

### ‚úÖ Completed Items

   - Scrape job creation form
   - Progress monitoring
   - Album assignment

3. **Admin Controls**
   - Admin-only scraping endpoints
   - Job history tracking

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Outstanding Issues

1. **SCRAPED_OUTPUT_PATH Not Initialized (CRITICAL)**
   - `server/tasks/scraping.py:22` shows `SCRAPED_OUTPUT_PATH = None` at runtime
   - Scraper will fail when invoked
   - **Action:** Initialize from config.yaml or environment variable before launching scraper

2. **Progress Reporting Minimal (LOW)**
   - Plan mentioned detailed scrape progress exposed to UI
   - Current implementation is basic
   - **Action:** Enhance if needed based on usage

---

## Phase 5: Training Pipeline ‚ö†Ô∏è (75% Complete)

### ‚úÖ Completed Items

1. **Training Backend**
   - Blueprint routes (server/routes/training.py)
   - Celery task: train_lora_task (server/tasks/training.py)
   - TrainingRun database model
   - Progress tracking (percentage, current_step, total_steps)

2. **Frontend UI**
   - TrainingTab.tsx (637 lines)
   - Training run creation form
   - Progress bars and status monitoring
   - Album selection for training data

3. **Training Script**
   - examples/train_lora.py already exists
   - Supports dataset loading and LoRA fine-tuning

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Outstanding Issues

1. **Training Album Selection Not Persisting (CRITICAL)**
   - Frontend sends album_ids in training config
   - `train_lora_task` expects them but they're not persisted correctly
   - Task fails with "No albums specified"
   - **Action:** Fix TrainingRun.album_ids persistence in creation endpoint

2. **Training Logs Placeholder (HIGH)**
   - Logs endpoint returns placeholder text
   - Planned log storage/streaming not implemented
   - **Action:** Capture subprocess output to file, serve via /api/training/runs/<id>/logs

3. **LoRA Registration Missing (MEDIUM)**
   - Trained LoRAs not automatically added to /api/loras list
   - Manual registration required
   - **Action:** Add post-training hook to index new LoRA files

4. **Cleanup of Training Directories (LOW)**
   - /tmp/training_* directories not cleaned up after completion
   - **Action:** Add cleanup in task finally block

---

## Cross-Cutting Issues

### 1. Celery Task Routing (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Problem:** Task naming inconsistency between registration and routing config

- Celery routing expects `server.tasks.labeling.*`
- Tasks registered as `tasks.*` (simplified names)

**Action:** Standardize task naming, update celery_app.py routing

### 2. Test Coverage Gaps (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Coverage Status:**
- Backend: ~70% coverage (good)
- Frontend: Vitest tests exist but admin UIs (Labeling, Scraping, Training) lack coverage

**Action:** Add integration tests for admin workflows

### 3. OpenAPI Documentation (LOW PRIORITY)

**Status:** Not implemented

**Action:** Add Swagger/OpenAPI spec for API documentation (future enhancement)

### 4. Monitoring Integration (LOW PRIORITY)

**Status:** Not implemented

**Action:** Consider Sentry or similar for production error tracking (future enhancement)

## Conclusion

The Imagineer platform is **nearly feature-complete** according to the REVISED_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN. The remaining work is primarily:

1. **Bug fixes** (album persistence, output paths)
2. **Integration gaps** (frontend labeling UI, async test updates)
3. **Polish** (logs streaming, auto-registration, cleanup)

With **2-3 days of focused work**, the platform can reach a fully functional state where all planned workflows (generation, albums, labeling, scraping, training) work end-to-end.

**Recommended Focus:**
1. Day 1: Fix critical blockers (#1, #2, #3)
2. Day 2: Add frontend labeling UI (#4), fix async issues (#5)
3. Day 3: Implement logs streaming (#6), add LoRA registration (#8)

This will result in a **production-ready MVP** with all core features operational.
