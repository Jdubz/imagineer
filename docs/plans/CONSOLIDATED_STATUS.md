## Conclusion

The Imagineer platform now delivers the MVP workflows end-to-end. Focus shifts from unblockers to polish:

1. Usability/documentation for admins (training & scraping telemetry)
2. Additional analytics/search features as future enhancements
3. Broader automated test coverage and operational tooling (migrations, monitoring)

No blocking defects remain; future work can be prioritized based on product goals rather than remediation.
